                <p>The Kingdom of Elenoir is established deep within the Forest of Elshire of Dicathen. It is located on
                    the northern border of the continent where a dense array of branches that fan out from the trees
                    cover most of the city in a canopy of shade. The capital of the Kingdom of Elenoir is the City of
                    Zestier, where the royal family resides. The capital is filled with numerous floating orbs of light
                    surrounding the city, creating a warm, luminescent glow. Buildings are made from jade-like material
                    intertwined by large, tall trees, and homes are built on unnaturally thick branches extending out of
                    massive trunks. The elven city is covered in a lush field of soft moss, with only narrow sidewalks
                    and the main road paved with smooth stone.

                    Within the City of Zestier, a large enormous tree made of white stone inhabiting the home of the
                    royal family. The interior of the castle had two curved staircases that created a circle, with a
                    grand chandelier made from the same orbs of light that surrounded the city, floating in the center.

                    border of the continent (western as seen in illustrations), the kingdom is primarily composed of
