                <p><b>The Kingdom of Elenoir</b> is established deep within the Forest of Elshire of Dicathen. It is located on
                    the northern border of the continent where a dense array of branches that fan out from the trees
                    cover most of the city in a canopy of shade. The capital of the Kingdom of Elenoir is the City of
                    Zestier, where the royal family resides. The capital is filled with numerous floating orbs of light
                    surrounding the city, creating a warm, luminescent glow. Buildings are made from jade-like material
                    intertwined by large, tall trees, and homes are built on unnaturally thick branches extending out of
                    massive trunks. The elven city is covered in a lush field of soft moss, with only narrow sidewalks
                    and the main road paved with smooth stone.<br><br>

                    Within the City of Zestier, a large enormous tree made of white stone inhabiting the home of the
                    royal family. The interior of the castle had two curved staircases that created a circle, with a
                    grand chandelier made from the same orbs of light that surrounded the city, floating in the center.<br><br>

                <p>The Kingdom of Sapin is the largest and most populated region of Dicathen. Located on the eastern
                    border of the continent (western as seen in illustrations), the kingdom is primarily composed of
                    humans, but there are also numerous merchants from the Dwarven race, trading many commodities.
                    Moreover, Sapin has a symbiotic relationship with the Kingdom of Darv when it comes to resources.

            <div class="imgdiv"><img src="src/img/ashbornmarket.png" style="width:70%;border-radius: 10px;"></div><br>
            This town of Ashber was more of a glorified outpost, seeing that there were no roads or buildings. People
            walked on the main dirt trail, where there were tents on both sides with various merchants and salesmen
            selling all sorts of things—from common, everyday necessities to things Arthur couldn’t help but raise a
            brow at, like weapons, armor, and rocks... shining rocks!<br><br>
            <b>Valden City</b><br>
            While operating in the city of Valden, Reynolds Leywin fell in love with an Adventurer Guild hall exam
            proctor named Alice Leywin, who he later married.
            <br><br>
            <b>Xyrus City</b><br><br>
            <div class="imgdiv"><img src="src/img/xyruscity.png" style="width:70%;border-radius: 10px;"></div><br>
            Xyrus City is a major city in the Kingdom of Sapin situated on a floating island above the center of
            Dicathen. Arthur read in a book about the creation story of Xyrus City. According to the book, this floating
            piece of land was built by an ancient organization of conjurers for the sole purpose of housing the most
            prestigious Mage Academy. A city was later built around the academy and both the City and the academy were
            named after the leader of the organization - Xyrus. Nevertheless, the truth is that Xyrus City was
            created by the Djinn, which was mentioned later in the story.
            <br><br>
            <b>Grand Mountains</b><br>
            Between the Forest of Elshire and the Kingdom of Sapin lies the Grand Mountain range which spans across
            roughly 90% of the continent, separating the North and East from the West and South. This mountain range is
            the place where Arthur Leywin and his family were attacked by a group of bandits.
            <br><br>
            <b>Dragonspine Inn</b><br>
            The Dragonspine Inn is where Arthur and Jasmine decided to go pick up some money. Arthur ended up getting
            challenged by a B-Rank Adventurer and Arthur cuts his fingers off.

            <div class="imgdiv"><img src="src/img/humanloyalty.png" style="width:70%;border-radius: 10px;"></div><br>
            Human Royalty is dressed in fine clothing with golden accessories across their attire, signifying their
            wealth. Both the king and queen wear crowns on top of their heads.
            <br><br>

            <div class="imgdiv"><img src="src/img/humanwarrior.png" style="width:70%;border-radius: 10px;"></div><br>
            The Royal Knight Guards were Knight armour and seem to be Augmenters, except for Sebastian who was not only
            a Conjurer, but also dressed differently from the rest.
            <br><br>
            <b>Hierarchy</b><br>
            This kingdom is a place of discrimination and classification. The hierarchical roots imbedded into this land
            would never truly disappear. Normal humans were considered second-rate people, while even amongst mages,
            augmenters were discriminated against by conjurers. It went further than that where, unless one was a
            deviant or a dual element specialist, some elements were considered "higher class" than others.
            <br><br>Slavery is still a thing in the Kingdom of Sapin unlike Arthur’s past world where slavery was
            abolished hundreds of years ago.<br><br>There also exists a division between nobles and commoners in this
            country.
